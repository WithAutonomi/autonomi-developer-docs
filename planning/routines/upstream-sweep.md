# Upstream sweep routine

## Purpose

Implements the `source audit -> draft -> verify` workflow defined in `planning/verification-workflow.md` on a daily cadence. Every weekday (and weekend) the routine checks every recorded `source_commit` in the docs and the developer skill against the corresponding upstream HEAD, audits any drifted page against the exact pinned SHAs the routine intends to stamp, and opens PRs or issues per the topology below.

The routine is the hosted-scheduled equivalent of Tier 1 + Tier 2 from `planning/implementation-plan.md` Section 8. It does not replace the eventual `repository_dispatch`-driven path; it sits alongside as an interim path that works without `notify-docs.yml` being installed in any upstream repo.

## Trigger shape

- Execution venue: Claude Code Remote routine.
- Schedule: daily at 09:00 UTC. Comfortably above the documented one-hour minimum interval for Remote-routine schedules.
- Routine model: **Opus 4.8 or higher** end-to-end. The audit/write/verify loop in `## Opus audit/write/verify loop` requires the model to inspect upstream diffs and source at pinned SHAs, compare against docs and `SKILL.md`, write actual prose into draft PRs, and run practical verification. No subagent layer.
- Prompt: the committed prompt at `planning/routines/upstream-sweep-prompt.md`.
- Body: the prompt invokes `scripts/sweep_poll.py` for deterministic detection, then runs the audit/write/verify loop against pinned upstream checkouts and opens PRs/issues per the topology.
- Webhook arm (`repository_dispatch` or per-event collation) is explicitly deferred to v2 of the trigger shape.

## Routine flow

1. Run the open-PR collision check. If a prior `claude/sweep-*` or `claude/prose-*` PR is still open, exit silently. The open PR is itself the signal that drift is pending review; drift is re-detected on the next run.
2. Run `scripts/sweep_poll.py`. If the JSON status is `error`, open a fresh issue (best-effort labelled `upstream-sweep-failure` — see `## GitHub artifacts the routine produces` for the label-fallback rule) with the JSON diagnostics and a brief cause prose in the body, and exit. A human triages the issue and closes it manually when the underlying cause is understood; the routine never auto-closes failure issues.
3. If `records` is empty or every record has `drifted: false`, exit silently. No GitHub artifact is produced for the happy no-drift path; the routine session log preserves the trace for debugging.
4. For each drifted record, run the `## Opus audit/write/verify loop` (fetch both SHAs, compute the upstream diff, inspect source artifacts, compare against docs and skill, classify the record, apply the page batching rule, write prose where required, run the deferred-record self-check, run practical verification).
5. Open at most two PRs (one sweep, one prose draft) plus zero or more issues (best-effort labelled `upstream-sweep-manual-review`) per the topology in `## Page batching rule`, `## Manual-review issue format`, `## Manual-review issue de-duplication`, and `## PR body format`. Manual-review issues are opened **before** PRs so PR bodies can reference issue numbers; a `Tracked in <PR URL>.` comment is posted on each issue once the corresponding PR exists. The PR bodies carry the run summary; no separate aggregated comment is posted anywhere.

## Branch convention

All routine-opened branches use the `claude/` namespace.

- Metadata-only stamp refreshes: `claude/sweep-<YYYY-MM-DD>` or `claude/sweep-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>` (the slug is optional for production runs and required for synthetic test PRs that exercise individual envelope rules).
- Prose-impact PRs: `claude/prose-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>`. Opened as **draft** PRs so the human reviewer promotes them to ready-for-review only after the prose has been read.

## GitHub artifacts the routine produces

Issues are reserved for things a human needs to address. Successful runs and routine no-ops produce no GitHub artifact at all; the routine session log is the transient debug trail for those.

| Outcome | GitHub artifact |
|---|---|
| No drift | None. Routine exits silently. |
| Drift found, all clean | Sweep PR (and prose draft PR if prose changed). The PR bodies are the run summary. |
| Drift + ambiguity | PRs plus one issue per deferred record, best-effort labelled `upstream-sweep-manual-review`. |
| Scanner error or mid-step error in step 5 (whole-run fail-closed) | One fresh issue per occurrence, best-effort labelled `upstream-sweep-failure`. The body carries the JSON diagnostic plus a brief cause prose. |
| Open-PR collision (prior `claude/sweep-*` or `claude/prose-*` still open) | None. The open PR is itself the signal. |

The two issue classes are kept distinct because the response differs:

- **`upstream-sweep-failure`** is reserved for routine-level failures that abort the whole run. The whole sweep stops; nothing is opened that day.
- **`upstream-sweep-manual-review`** is for per-record audit deferrals (page-batching cases 3, 4, 5, and SHA-fetch-and-compare double-failures for a single record). The routine continues with the rest of the run; these are routine output, not error signals.

Both labels are best-effort. The routine attempts to attach the intended label when it creates an issue, but if the label is missing or the token lacks label-write permission, it falls back to creating the issue without the label and adds an in-body note explaining the omission and quoting the underlying `gh` error. The routine never blocks on label hygiene — label management is a low-stakes cleanup task a human can handle after the fact. Only a real issue-creation failure (auth, network, or `issues: write` permission error) aborts.

`upstream-sweep-failure` issues are not auto-closed. A successful next run does not mean the underlying cause is fixed — it can mean the run did not hit the same condition. A human reads the diagnostic on each failure issue and closes it deliberately. Duplicate failure issues are tolerated rather than deduplicated: each one is a discrete observation that something went wrong.

`upstream-sweep-manual-review` issues are fingerprint-deduplicated per `## Manual-review issue de-duplication` — a record whose `head_sha` has not moved since the previous run reuses the existing issue rather than opening a duplicate.

## Open-PR collision handling

Before opening any new PR, list open PRs and filter `headRefName` by prefix client-side:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --limit 1000 --json number,headRefName \
  --jq '.[] | select(.headRefName | startswith("claude/sweep-") or startswith("claude/prose-"))'
```

`--limit 1000` defeats `gh`'s default 30-row cap so a busy repo cannot hide a still-open prior sweep/prose PR behind pagination — without it the routine would see "no results" and open a colliding PR. GitHub's `--search` syntax does not reliably match branch prefixes, so the JSON list with a client-side prefix filter is the trustworthy form.

If any results come back regardless of date, the routine exits silently. The open PR is itself the signal that drift is pending review; no separate comment or issue is needed. Drift is re-detected on the next run after the prior PR(s) merge or close. This forces a clean serial cadence and prevents PR accumulation.

## Audit-diff fetch rule

For each drifted record, the routine must inspect the diff between `recorded_sha` and `head_sha` against the upstream tree at `head_sha`. **Both SHAs are required.**

Default path: fetch both exact SHAs into a fresh tmp dir without changing the routine's cwd.

```bash
TMP=$(mktemp -d)
git -C "$TMP" init -q
git -C "$TMP" remote add origin <url>
git -C "$TMP" fetch --depth 1 origin <recorded_sha>
git -C "$TMP" fetch --depth 1 origin <head_sha>
git -C "$TMP" checkout --detach <head_sha>
```

Then `git -C "$TMP" log <recorded_sha>..<head_sha>` and `git -C "$TMP" diff <recorded_sha>..<head_sha>` work against the upstream tree while the routine's cwd remains the docs repo. Every git command in the audit step must carry `-C "$TMP"`; a bare `git log` or `git diff` would inspect the docs repo by accident. See `planning/routines/upstream-sweep-prompt.md` Step 4.1 and Step 4.2 for the executable form.

Fallback path: if either `git fetch` fails (reachable-SHA fetches disabled by the repo, SHA garbage-collected, network failure), use the GitHub compare API:

```bash
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<recorded_sha>...<head_sha>"
```

Read `commits[]`, `files[]`, and the `status` field from the response.

Per-record fail-closed: if **both** the local fetch and the compare API fail for a record, open a `manual review needed` issue for that page and skip the page from both PRs. Continue with the rest of the run.

**Never compare against a moving branch name** (`main`, `master`, etc.). The audit must reference the exact pinned SHAs the routine plans to stamp. `git clone --depth N` is rejected because an arbitrary `N` may not contain the target SHA. `git fetch <ref>` is rejected because the ref may have moved between the scanner run and the audit run.

The routine cleans up tmp dirs after each run.

## Page batching rule

After every record on every drifted page is classified by the audit loop, apply the five-case rule per page:

1. **No ambiguous + any prose** → prose PR. All audited non-ambiguous records on that page (prose-impacting **and** metadata-only) are stamped in the same PR. The page never appears on the sweep PR.
2. **No ambiguous + all metadata-only** → sweep PR.
3. **Ambiguous + no prose** → manual-review issue, no PR for that page. Metadata-only records on the same page are deferred alongside the ambiguity rather than spun off into a sweep PR.
4. **Ambiguous overlapping prose, or unproven independence** → manual-review issue, no PR for that page. Two records overlap when they share any of: claim, page section, code sample, command, endpoint, source artifact, or `<!-- verification: -->` block.
5. **Ambiguous + prose with proven independence** → prose PR for the prose-affected records and any metadata-only records on the same page that are also independent of every deferred ambiguity (same overlap dimensions). Ambiguous records and any metadata-only records that share an overlap dimension with a deferred ambiguity stay unstamped: every byte inside the deferred record's `<!-- verification: ... -->` block (including `source_repo:`, `source_ref:`, `source_commit:`, `verified_date:`, `verification_mode:`, comments, and any other field) stays byte-identical to base. One manual-review issue per deferred record tracks the unresolved evidence.

The two PRs never touch the same page. A prose PR may touch a page with deferred ambiguous records but must not edit any byte inside those records' verification blocks. The deferred-record self-check at PR-open time confirms the entire block is byte-identical to base; the routine fails closed on mismatch and does not open the prose PR.

## Manual-review issue format

Every manual-review issue attempts to carry the `upstream-sweep-manual-review` label (distinct from `upstream-sweep-failure`); label attach is best-effort per `## GitHub artifacts the routine produces`, so an issue created via the unlabeled fallback is still a valid manual-review issue and is identified by the fingerprint in its body.

- Title for cases 3 and 4: `manual review needed for <page>`.
- Title for case 5 (deferred record from a prose PR with proven independent ambiguity): `manual review needed for deferred record in <page>`.
- Body includes:
  - exact record location (`file:line` and the verification block content),
  - upstream SHA range (`recorded_sha..head_sha`),
  - the ambiguity reason,
  - the independence rationale (case 5 only),
  - a deterministic `Fingerprint:` line on its own line, surrounded by blank lines, of the form:
    - docs records: `Fingerprint: <repo_path>:<line>|<source_repo>|<recorded_sha>..<head_sha>`,
    - skill `version.json` records: `Fingerprint: skill_version_json|<repo_key>|<recorded_sha>..<head_sha>`,
    - skill `SKILL.md` records: `Fingerprint: skill_md|<repo_key>|<recorded_sha>..<head_sha>`.

The fingerprint includes the SHA range so a record whose `head_sha` advanced since the previous run is treated as a new event with a new issue, while a record that has not moved reuses the existing issue.

## Manual-review issue de-duplication

Deferred records are not stamped, so the next run will rediscover them and would otherwise re-open a duplicate issue every day. Before creating a new manual-review issue, the routine lists every open issue (no label filter) and matches the fingerprint client-side as an exact-line match:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 1000 --json number,title,body
```

The label filter is deliberately omitted. Label attach is best-effort: a previous run may have created the manual-review issue without the label (when the label was missing or the token lacked label-write permission). Filtering on the label would miss those issues, the dedup would fail, and a duplicate would be created on every subsequent run. The fingerprint in the body is the durable identifier.

`gh issue search` is not used: GitHub issue search tokenization does not reliably match a pipe-heavy fingerprint embedded in the body. The match is performed by walking each candidate issue's `body` field and looking for a line that, after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, equals the fingerprint string verbatim — not a substring match.

On a fingerprint match, the routine reuses the existing issue: it skips `gh issue create`, captures the existing issue's number for the prose PR body, and posts a `Tracked in <PR URL>. (Run date <today>.)` comment on the issue once the PR exists. The original issue body is not edited, so reused issues accumulate a chronological trail of every run that re-encountered them. With no fingerprint match, a new issue is created with the fingerprint embedded in the body.

## Sweep PR envelope (claude/sweep-*)

`claude/sweep-*` PRs are metadata-only.

Allowed:

- verification-block lines (`source_commit:`, `verified_date:`) in `docs/**/*.md`,
- the `verified_commits` map in `skills/start/version.json` (key set unchanged),
- the `verified_commits` map and the `verified_date:` line in `skills/start/SKILL.md`'s YAML frontmatter (key set unchanged),
- one new `planning/sweeps/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` whose date suffix matches the head-branch date suffix.

Forbidden:

- any change to docs prose (`docs/**/*.md` outside an `<!-- verification: -->` block),
- any change to `skills/start/SKILL.md` body (anything outside the YAML frontmatter),
- any change to the `version:` line in `SKILL.md` frontmatter,
- any change to `version` or `published_date` in `version.json`,
- any change to `skills/start/CHANGELOG.md`,
- any change to `scripts/**`, `.github/**`, `repo-registry.yml`, `component-registry.yml`,
- any add or remove of a key in the `verified_commits` map of `version.json` or `SKILL.md` frontmatter (key sets locked; values may refresh).

`sweep-guard` enforces this envelope. It runs on `claude/sweep-*` only and green-skips on every other branch.

## Prose PR envelope (claude/prose-*)

`claude/prose-*` PRs allow rendered prose changes plus the linked skill patch release when the audit found skill impact.

Allowed:

- `docs/**/*.md` — any change.
- `skills/start/SKILL.md` — frontmatter and/or body may change. If body changes, the linked-release rule below applies in full.
- `skills/start/version.json` — `verified_commits` value updates always (key set unchanged); `version` and `published_date` only as part of a linked release.
- `skills/start/CHANGELOG.md` — only as part of a linked release.
- `planning/sweeps/<branch-date>.md` — optional add; date suffix matches `claude/prose-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>`.

Forbidden:

- any change to `scripts/**`, `.github/**`, `repo-registry.yml`, `component-registry.yml` (byte-identical to base),
- any add or remove of a key in the `verified_commits` map of `version.json` or `SKILL.md` frontmatter,
- any change to `version`, `published_date`, frontmatter `version:`, or `CHANGELOG.md` **when the `SKILL.md` body is byte-identical to base** (release metadata may only move with a body change),
- any of the linked-release fields missing **when the `SKILL.md` body has changed**.

Linked-release rule (both directions):

If `skills/start/SKILL.md` body bytes differ between base and head, the same PR must include all of:

- `skills/start/version.json: version` bumped to a new patch version (`MAJOR.MINOR.(PATCH+1)`),
- `skills/start/version.json: published_date` updated,
- `skills/start/SKILL.md` frontmatter `version:` matching the new `version.json: version`,
- `skills/start/SKILL.md` frontmatter `verified_date:` updated,
- `skills/start/CHANGELOG.md` adding one new entry whose header matches the new `version`.

If the `SKILL.md` body is byte-identical between base and head, **none** of `version`, `published_date`, frontmatter `version:`, or `CHANGELOG.md` may change.

`prose-guard` enforces this envelope. It runs on `claude/prose-*` only and green-skips on every other branch.

## Opus audit/write/verify loop

Required model: **Opus 4.8 or higher**. The deterministic scanner is only the drift detector; audit, prose-writing, and verification are first-class duties of the routine.

For each drifted record:

1. **Fetch both SHAs** per `## Audit-diff fetch rule`. If both fetch and compare API fail, fail closed for the page → manual-review issue.
2. **Compute the upstream diff**: `git -C "$TMP" log --oneline <recorded>..<head>`, `git -C "$TMP" diff --stat <recorded>..<head>`, targeted `git -C "$TMP" diff <recorded>..<head> -- <path>`. Every git invocation in this step carries `-C "$TMP"` so it inspects the upstream checkout rather than the docs repo. Or read the compare API response when running via fallback.
3. **Inspect upstream source artifacts** at `head_sha` (OpenAPI specs, `.proto` files, CLI source and `--help` output, public Rust modules, README/docs). Use `repo-registry.yml`'s `topics:` and `component-registry.yml`'s component map to focus on artifacts the affected page actually depends on.
4. **Compare against the affected docs pages** and `skills/start/SKILL.md`. Identify any rendered claim, code sample, command, endpoint, type, field, or live-reference URL that no longer matches the pinned source.
5. **Classify the record** as `metadata-only`, `prose`, or `ambiguous` (see prompt step 4.5 for criteria).
6. **Apply the page batching rule** once every record is classified.
7. **Write prose changes directly into the draft `claude/prose-*` PR** when the page is in the prose batch. Apply `CLAUDE.md`'s voice, terminology lockfile, page templates, and refusal rules. The PR diff must contain the prose edit, not merely a suggestion in the PR body.
8. **Skill-aware prose**: if the audit finds skill impact, include both the docs change and the `SKILL.md` change in the same prose PR. If `SKILL.md` body changes, the same PR must include the linked patch release set per `## Prose PR envelope`.
9. **Deferred-record self-check** (case 5 only — prose PR opened with proven-independent ambiguous records held back). For every deferred record, the routine confirms the entire `<!-- verification: ... -->` block on the prose-PR branch is byte-identical to base. Every byte from the opening `<!-- verification:` to the closing `-->` is checked, including `source_repo:`, `source_ref:`, `source_commit:`, `verified_date:`, `verification_mode:`, comments, and any other line. Checking only `source_commit:` and `verified_date:` is too narrow: the loop can edit `source_ref:`, change `verification_mode:`, or rewrite a comment inside the block without realising it crossed the deferred-record boundary. The routine also confirms the prose PR body contains a `Deferred ambiguous records:` section that links each open `upstream-sweep-manual-review` issue by number for those records. The guards cannot enforce this — they have no way to know which records were classified ambiguous — so the routine is the only thing that catches an accidental edit. **Fail closed on mismatch: do not open the prose PR.**

10. **Practical verification before opening a prose PR**, where available: lint/format checks; re-run `scripts/sweep_poll.py` and confirm `status: "ok"`; parse `SKILL.md` frontmatter and `version.json` to confirm the linked-release rule holds when the body changed; language-appropriate syntax checks for changed code samples; targeted re-grep against the pinned upstream checkout for endpoint/type claims. If a check cannot be run, state that explicitly in the PR body — never silently skip.

## PR body format

Both sweep and prose PR bodies must include:

- **Upstream**: repo name and SHA range checked, e.g. `ant-sdk: 1cbfb3e → d7652ec`.
- **Source artifacts inspected**: short list, e.g. `antd/openapi.yaml`, `docs/sdk/reference/rest-api.md` upstream.
- **Developer-facing change**: one or two sentences describing what changed for users of the documented surface, or "internal refactor; no developer-facing impact".
- **Files changed in this PR**: bulleted list of docs pages and skill files.
- **Why prose changed** (prose PR only): one or two sentences per page explaining the rendered-text edit and which upstream artifact it tracks.
- **Verification run**: bulleted list of which practical checks ran and their result, or "skipped — <reason>" per check.
- **Uncertainties**: one or two sentences calling out any judgment calls or partial evidence the human reviewer should re-check, or "none".

The body is intentionally concise — no full audit transcript — but every claim is traceable to the pinned `head_sha`. The reviewer should be able to skim the body in under a minute and know exactly what to spot-check.

## Credentials and access

The routine needs:

- read access to all in-scope upstream repos for GitHub API HEAD lookups and the shallow clones,
- write access to `withautonomi/autonomi-developer-docs` for branch push, PR creation, and comment/issue creation.

Read access uses a token tier that the prompt resolves at runtime, in order:

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the routine environment, when set. Recommended for the higher authenticated rate limit (5000 req/hour) and broadest cross-org access.
2. `gh auth token`, when the routine sandbox carries a GitHub App installation token usable by the `gh` CLI. Provides the higher rate limit on repos covered by the installation; for orgs outside the installation, the scanner's authenticated-403-to-anonymous retry handles the lookup.
3. Anonymous REST reads, as a fallback when the authenticated request 403s. Limited to 60 req/hour on the sandbox IP.
4. Unauthenticated `git ls-remote` against the public clone URL, as a final fallback for HEAD-SHA and default-branch resolution. The git smart-HTTP protocol uses a separate code path from the REST API, so this bypasses both org-level fine-grained PAT restrictions and the REST anonymous rate limit. Only works for public repos.

Write access uses the `gh` CLI. `gh` respects `GITHUB_TOKEN` when set, so a configured `GITHUB_TOKEN` must include the docs-repo write scopes (`contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`) — otherwise issue, label, and PR creation will fail at runtime. When `GITHUB_TOKEN` is unset, `gh` uses its stored auth context (typically a GitHub App installation token, which has the necessary scopes by design). The routine never writes against an upstream repo, only against `withautonomi/autonomi-developer-docs`.

Token preferences for production runs, in priority order:

- A dedicated GitHub App installation token (refreshed per run) with `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write` on the docs repo and `contents: read` on the in-scope upstream repos. The App token reaches the routine through both `gh auth` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var.
- A fine-grained personal access token with the same scopes, stored as a routine secret in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Note that fine-grained PATs may be refused at the org level for upstreams in orgs that restrict them, in which case the scanner falls through to anonymous reads for those repos.

The repo file does not contain the secret value, only the policy.

## Audit gating

SHAs are bumped only after the per-page audit step succeeds against the pinned upstream checkout. If audit fails for a page (ambiguous evidence, removed surface, deleted file, both SHA-fetch paths failing), the page does not enter any PR — it is surfaced as a `manual review needed` issue. The scanner's drift report is a candidate list, not a directive.

## Fail-closed semantics

Scanner fail-closed (whole run aborts):

- GitHub API 4xx/5xx on a HEAD or repo metadata lookup, after the resolver has exhausted its fallbacks. An authenticated 403 is retried once without the `Authorization` header, and a still-failing HEAD or default-branch lookup is then re-attempted via unauthenticated `git ls-remote` against the public clone URL. The run aborts only when every path fails. The diagnostic captures the response body, rate-limit state, `x-github-request-id`, and `retry-after` for each REST attempt, plus the `git ls-remote` outcome, so the status comment can distinguish org-policy refusal from anonymous-quota exhaustion from a transient outage.
- network timeout,
- malformed `<!-- verification:` block (missing `source_repo`, `source_ref`, `source_commit`, or `verification_mode`),
- missing or unknown file-level `verification_mode` on `version.json` or `SKILL.md` frontmatter,
- unparseable `repo-registry.yml`,
- unparseable `version.json` or `SKILL.md` frontmatter,
- unknown `source_repo` not in the registry,
- `verification_mode` set to a value other than `current-merged-truth` or `target-manifest`.

The routine treats any non-zero scanner exit as an error condition, opens a fresh `upstream-sweep-failure`-labelled issue with the JSON diagnostics in the body, and exits without opening any PR. The diagnostic includes the response body, rate-limit state, `x-github-request-id`, `retry-after`, and the `git ls-remote` fallback outcome so the issue body alone is enough to triage the cause.

Per-record fail-closed (one page deferred, rest of run continues):

- both `git fetch <recorded_sha>` and `git fetch <head_sha>` fail and the compare API also fails for the same record.

That page is held back as a `manual review needed` issue.

`target-manifest` blocks are deliberately skipped by the scanner and listed in a separate `target_manifest_skipped` array in the JSON output. When the run opens a sweep PR, the PR body and the per-run `planning/sweeps/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` summary file note any target-manifest entries as "pinned by target-manifest, not bumped" so a human can confirm those pins remain intentional during review. The routine must never bump a `target-manifest` block against a moving HEAD; doing so would silently overwrite a launch-hardening pin.

## Failure modes

- GitHub API rate-limit during the daily poll. Handled by the scanner's fail-closed semantics: the routine opens a fresh `upstream-sweep-failure` issue with the diagnostic and waits for the next run.
- Deleted or renamed source repo. Same handling.
- Force-push that invalidates a recorded SHA. Caught by the `sweep-sha-reachability` required check on the resulting PR.
- Routine missing the 09:00 UTC slot. Recovery: next-day run picks up the drift; latency at most 24h. No GitHub artifact.
- Claude Code Remote routine credential or token expiry. Routine fails closed; the hosted run history captures the diagnostic. The routine opens a failure issue only when its GitHub write credentials still permit issue creation.
- Daily routine-start cap exhausted on Max plan. Same recovery as missed slot.
- Collision skip when a prior PR is left open for many days. The open PR is itself the signal; the next-day run resumes once the prior PR merges or closes.
- SHA-fetch failure for a single record (both fetch paths). Recovery: page deferred to an `upstream-sweep-manual-review` issue; the rest of the run proceeds.

## Alignment with implementation-plan.md Section 8

The routine is a hosted-scheduled, polling-based equivalent of Tier 1 + Tier 2 of Section 8.

Differences from the per-event arm:

- pull-shaped from a scheduler instead of `repository_dispatch`-driven,
- narrower envelope (metadata-only sweep PR plus optional prose draft PR),
- no per-event collation in v1.

Forward compatibility: when `notify-docs.yml` rolls out in upstream repos, the same routine can grow a webhook-receiver arm without invalidating the daily-poll v1.

## One-time setup

1. Recommended (not required): create both routine labels manually in the docs repo (Settings → Labels → New label) so the issues the routine opens are filterable from the start:
   - `upstream-sweep-manual-review` — "Ambiguous upstream-sweep records that need a human decision".
   - `upstream-sweep-failure` — "Fail-closed upstream-sweep run; needs human triage".

   If either label is missing, the routine still creates the issue when needed, falls back to creating it unlabeled, and adds an in-body note explaining the missed label and the underlying `gh` error. The labels can be created and reapplied to existing issues at any time.
2. Add `sweep-guard`, `prose-guard`, and `sweep-sha-reachability` (the exact workflow `name:` strings) as required checks on `main` in repo settings → Branch protection.
3. Confirm the routine's bot identity has push access. If branch protection requires reviewers, ensure the bot is granted bypass or has CODEOWNERS coverage on `planning/sweeps/*` and the metadata-only paths, or accept that the user reviews each PR by hand.
4. If using a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret, provision it in the Claude Code Remote routine config per the credentials section above. The secret is optional; when unset the routine derives a token from `gh auth token` and falls back to anonymous reads.

## Out of scope

- Claude Code Remote routine config (model = Opus 4.8 or higher, schedule, any optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret value) lives in the hosted routine service, not in this repo. The behaviour (the prompt) is committed at `planning/routines/upstream-sweep-prompt.md`.
- `notify-docs.yml` installation in any upstream repo — tracked under `planning/implementation-plan.md` Section 8.2.
- Per-event sweep PRs — deferred to v2 of the trigger shape.
- Auto-merge — deferred to v1.5. The label-driven `sweep-auto-merge` workflow ships once all three required checks have run cleanly for several weeks.
- Terminology lint, Greptile reviewer setup, and broader v2 verification-staleness checks beyond the sweep envelope.
