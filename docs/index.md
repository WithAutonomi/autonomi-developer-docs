Autonomi is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for permanent, immutable data storage. Data is encrypted client-side before upload, and the network's transport and security model use post-quantum cryptography. You pay once in ANT token when you upload data, then retrieve it later with a public address or a DataMap.

## Choose your path

### Build an app with the SDKs

Use the SDK path if you want a local daemon plus SDKs in Python, Node.js / TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, Dart, Zig, and other supported languages. `antd` runs on your machine and exposes REST and gRPC so your application can talk to Autonomi through a stable local API.

Start with [Build with the SDKs](getting-started/install.md), then [Your First Upload with the SDKs](getting-started/hello-world.md).

### Use the ant CLI

Use the CLI when you want direct shell access to the network for uploads, downloads, wallet checks, chunk operations, or node-management workflows.

Start with [Use the ant CLI](getting-started/using-ant-client.md).

### Build directly in Rust

Use the direct Rust path when you want daemon-free, programmatic control over networking, payments, and uploads with `ant-core`.

Start with [Build Directly in Rust](getting-started/build-directly-in-rust.md).
