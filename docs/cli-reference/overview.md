# CLI Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is preview documentation for Autonomi 2.0 ahead of the planned network launch on 7 April 2026. Content is under active review and may change before launch.
{% endhint %}

`ant` is the command-line interface for Autonomi. It gives you direct shell access to uploads, downloads, wallet inspection, self-update, chunk operations, and node-management workflows without running the SDK daemon.

## When to use the CLI

Use the CLI when you want:

* Direct CLI access for file, chunk, wallet, or node-management workflows
* Direct control over bootstrap peers, devnet manifests, and EVM network selection
* Shell-first automation or operational workflows

If you want SDK ergonomics in other languages, use the SDKs instead. If you want daemon-free programmatic Rust access, see [Developing in Rust](../rust-reference/overview.md).

## CLI shape

The CLI has these top-level groups:

* `ant file`
* `ant chunk`
* `ant wallet`
* `ant node`
* `ant update`

It also accepts global flags such as:

* `--json`
* `-V`, `--version`
* `--bootstrap`
* `--devnet-manifest`
* `--allow-loopback`
* `--timeout-secs`
* `--chunk-concurrency`
* `--log-level`
* `--evm-network`

## Installation

Install scripts are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and you can also build the CLI from source.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WithAutonomi/ant-client/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Relationship to the other paths

The CLI, SDK, and native Rust paths reach the same network, but they have different shapes:

|                     | SDKs                              | CLI                            | Native Rust                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Interface model     | daemon + SDK bindings             | direct CLI                     | direct Rust library          |
| Best for            | app development in many languages | shell workflows and operations | daemon-free Rust development |
| Local process model | requires `antd`                   | no daemon for data commands    | no daemon                    |
| Main entry point    | REST/gRPC via `antd`              | `ant` command                  | `ant-core` crate             |
