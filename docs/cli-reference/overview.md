`ant` is the command-line interface for Autonomi. It gives you direct shell access to uploads, downloads, wallet inspection, chunk operations, and node-management workflows without running the SDK daemon.

## When to use the CLI

Use the CLI when you want:

- direct CLI access for file, chunk, wallet, or node-management workflows
- direct control over bootstrap peers, devnet manifests, and EVM network selection
- shell-first automation or operational workflows

If you want SDK ergonomics in other languages, use the SDK path instead. If you want daemon-free programmatic Rust access, see [Developing in Rust](../rust-reference/overview.md).

## CLI shape

The CLI has these top-level groups:

- `ant file`
- `ant chunk`
- `ant wallet`
- `ant node`

It also accepts global flags such as:

- `--json`
- `--bootstrap`
- `--devnet-manifest`
- `--allow-loopback`
- `--timeout-secs`
- `--chunk-concurrency`
- `--log-level`
- `--evm-network`

## Installation

The current README documents install scripts for Linux, macOS, and Windows, plus source builds from the repo.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WithAutonomi/ant-client/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Relationship to the other paths

The CLI, SDK, and native Rust paths reach the same network, but they have different shapes:

| | SDK path | CLI path | Native Rust path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interface model | daemon + SDK bindings | direct CLI | direct Rust library |
| Best for | app development in many languages | shell workflows and operations | daemon-free Rust development |
| Local process model | requires `antd` | no daemon for data commands | no daemon |
| Main entry point | REST/gRPC via `antd` | `ant` command | `ant-core` crate |
