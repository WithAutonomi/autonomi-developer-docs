Rust gives you two supported ways to build on Autonomi.

## Choose your Rust path

### Rust through the SDK daemon

Use the Rust SDK when you want Rust code to talk to `antd` just like the other SDK languages do.

Choose this path if you want:

- the same daemon-based model used by Python, Node.js / TypeScript, Go, and the other SDKs
- REST or gRPC access through a stable local gateway
- a Rust app that fits into the broader SDK workflow

See [Rust SDK](../sdk-reference/language-bindings/rust.md).

### Native Rust with ant-core

Use `ant-core` when you want direct, daemon-free Rust access to networking, uploads, and payment flows.

Choose this path if you want:

- direct control over the network client in Rust
- no daemon process between your code and the network
- access to native Rust types and local devnet helpers

See [Build Directly in Rust](../getting-started/build-directly-in-rust.md) and [Rust Library Reference](../cli-reference/ant-core-library.md).

## How the two Rust paths differ

| | Rust SDK | `ant-core` |
|---|---|---|
| Interface model | daemon-based | direct Rust library |
| Network access | through `antd` | direct |
| Good fit | SDK-style app development | native Rust control |
| Closest equivalent | Python / Node.js / TypeScript SDKs | no daemon equivalent |
