Autonomi is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for permanent, immutable data storage. Data is encrypted client-side before upload, and the network's transport and security model use post-quantum cryptography. You pay in ANT token when you upload data, and the storage model is designed around pay-once uploads rather than ongoing storage fees.

## What makes it different

At a high level, Autonomi gives you:

- immutable data storage: changing the content produces a new address instead of mutating the old one
- client-side encryption through self-encryption before chunks are stored on the network
- public and private retrieval paths through addresses and DataMaps
- pay-once storage: you pay when you upload, and downloads are free

## Three ways to build on Autonomi

### 1. Build an app with the SDKs

This is the easiest starting point for most developers.

- `antd` runs as a local daemon on your machine
- it exposes REST and gRPC endpoints
- language SDKs talk to that daemon for you

Choose this path if you want to build in Python, Node.js / TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, Dart, Zig, or another supported SDK language.

### 2. Use the ant CLI

This path gives you direct command-line access to uploads, downloads, chunk operations, wallet inspection, and node-management workflows.

Choose it when you want shell access, automation scripts, or a daemon-free operational workflow.

### 3. Build directly in Rust

This path uses `ant-core` directly instead of going through the daemon.

Choose it when you want native Rust control over networking, payment flows, and upload logic.

## What matters first as a developer

Start with these concepts:

- [Data Types](../core-concepts/data-types.md)
- [Self-Encryption](../core-concepts/self-encryption.md)
- [Payment Model](../core-concepts/payment-model.md)

You do not need to understand every network detail before storing and retrieving data, but you do need to understand that uploads are content-addressed, immutable, and paid for at write time.
