{% hint style="warning" %}
This is preview documentation for Autonomi 2.0 ahead of the planned network launch on 7 April 2026. Content is under active review and may change before launch.
{% endhint %}

Autonomi is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for permanent, immutable data storage. Data is encrypted before upload, stored using content-addressing, and paid for once when you write it to the network.

## What makes Autonomi different

At a high level, Autonomi gives you:

- immutable storage, where changing the content produces a new address instead of mutating the old one
- client-side encryption through self-encryption before chunks are stored on the network
- public and private retrieval paths through addresses and DataMaps
- pay-once storage, where you pay in Autonomi Network Token (ANT) when you upload and downloads are free
- post-quantum cryptography in the transport and security model

## Ways to build on Autonomi

You can build on Autonomi in several ways.

### Build an app with the SDKs

This is the easiest starting point for most developers.

- `antd` runs as a local daemon on your machine
- it exposes REST and gRPC endpoints
- SDKs are available in more than 15 languages

Choose this route if you want to build with Python, Node.js / TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby, PHP, Dart, Zig, or another supported SDK language.

### Use the ant CLI

The CLI gives you direct command-line access to uploads, downloads, chunk operations, wallet inspection, and node-management workflows.

Choose it when you want shell access, scripts, or a daemon-free operational workflow.

### Build in Rust with ant-core

This route uses the native Rust library instead of the daemon.

Choose it when you want direct Rust control over networking, payment flows, and upload logic in your application.

## What to understand first

Start with these core concepts:

- [Data Types](../core-concepts/data-types.md)
- [Self-Encryption](../core-concepts/self-encryption.md)
- [Payment Model](../core-concepts/payment-model.md)
- [Post-Quantum Cryptography](../core-concepts/post-quantum-cryptography.md)
- [Key Derivation](../core-concepts/key-derivation.md)

You do not need to understand every network detail before you store and retrieve data, but it helps to understand that uploads are content-addressed, immutable, and paid for at write time.

## Next steps

- [Build with the SDKs](install.md)
- [Use the ant CLI](using-ant-client.md)
- [Build in Rust with ant-core](build-directly-in-rust.md)
- [GitHub](../github.md)
