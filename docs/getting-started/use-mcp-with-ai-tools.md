Use MCP when you want an AI tool such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or another MCP-compatible client to store and retrieve data on Autonomi through structured tools instead of direct HTTP requests. This path still uses `antd` under the hood, but the MCP server handles the bridge between your AI client and the daemon.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An MCP-compatible client such as Claude Desktop or Claude Code
- `antd` built and running on your machine (see [Start the Local Daemon](using-the-autonomi-daemon.md))

## Steps

### 1. Start the local daemon

The MCP server talks to `antd`, so start there first:

```bash
./target/release/antd
```

If you have not built `antd` yet, follow [Build with the SDKs](install.md) and [Start the Local Daemon](using-the-autonomi-daemon.md) first.

### 2. Install the MCP server

From the `ant-sdk` repo root:

```bash
pip install "antd[rest]"
pip install -e antd-mcp/
```

### 3. Configure your AI client

For Claude Desktop, add `antd-mcp` to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "antd-autonomi": {
      "command": "antd-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Continue with the full MCP setup

Use the full setup guide next. It covers daemon discovery, SSE mode, and overrides such as `ANTD_BASE_URL`.

## What happened

You chose the MCP path as your entry point into Autonomi. Your AI client talks to `antd-mcp`, and the MCP server calls `antd` on your behalf.
