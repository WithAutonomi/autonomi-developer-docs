Build read-only Autonomi features when you only need to retrieve data that has already been stored and paid for.

This can describe a small read-only feature inside a larger application or an entire application that only retrieves existing data.

## Why this matters

Read-only features are simpler than upload-enabled ones.

If your application only reads data that has already been written to the network:

- you do not need ANT
- you do not need gas
- you do not need a wallet
- you do not need upload permissions

That can make retrieval-only tools, dashboards, content browsers, and other read-heavy features much easier to build and operate.

## Prerequisites

- A known public address to retrieve, or a `DataMap` for private data
- One of these routes:
  - SDKs through `antd`
  - the `ant` CLI
  - native Rust with `ant-core`

If you do not already have an address or `DataMap`, create one first by following [Store and Retrieve Data with the SDKs](store-and-retrieve-data.md) or the equivalent CLI/Rust route.

## Steps

### 1. Choose the route you want to use

For SDKs and the local daemon:

- [Build with the SDKs](../getting-started/install.md)
- [Start the Local Daemon](../getting-started/using-the-autonomi-daemon.md)
- [Retrieve Data from the Network](../getting-started/retrieve-data-from-the-network.md)

For the CLI:

- [Use the CLI](../getting-started/using-ant-client.md)

For native Rust:

- [Build Directly in Rust](../getting-started/build-directly-in-rust.md)

### 2. Retrieve public or private data

For public data, you need a public address.

For private data, you need the `DataMap` or equivalent private retrieval material.

For the SDK route, `antd` can run without `AUTONOMI_WALLET_KEY` when you only need retrieval.

Public retrieval through the daemon:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8082/v1/data/public/<address>
```

Private retrieval through the daemon:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8082/v1/data/private?data_map=<hex_encoded_datamap>"
```

The private retrieval response is JSON with the content returned as base64 in the `data` field.

For the CLI route, public and private file retrieval use `ant file download` with either a public address or a local `.datamap` file:

```bash
ant file download <public_address> -o downloaded.bin --bootstrap 1.2.3.4:12000
ant file download --datamap my_data.bin.datamap -o downloaded.bin --bootstrap 1.2.3.4:12000
```

For native Rust, use the retrieval APIs in `ant-core` after connecting to the network client.

### 3. Keep wallet setup out of your architecture unless you also upload

If your application only reads data that has already been stored, it does not need:

- `AUTONOMI_WALLET_KEY`
- `SECRET_KEY`
- token approvals
- upload payment flows

That means you can keep the architecture focused on retrieval and content handling instead of wallet management.

## Verify it worked

Your read-only feature is configured correctly when it can retrieve the expected content from a known public address or private `DataMap` without any wallet setup.

## Common errors

**404 Not Found**: Check the address.

**Trying to use private retrieval without a DataMap**: Private content still requires the retrieval metadata even though the content has already been paid for.

## Next steps

- [Store and Retrieve Data with the SDKs](store-and-retrieve-data.md)
- [Payment Model](../core-concepts/payment-model.md)
- [Use the CLI](../getting-started/using-ant-client.md)
