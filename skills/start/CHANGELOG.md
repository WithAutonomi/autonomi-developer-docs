## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.6-draft] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Updated shared daemon surfaces: `POST /v1/data/private` renamed to `POST /v1/data`; `GET /v1/data/private` replaced by `POST /v1/data/get` (DataMap now in request body, not query parameter); `POST /v1/files/upload/public` renamed to `POST /v1/files/public`; `POST /v1/files/download/public` renamed to `POST /v1/files/public/get`; added `POST /v1/files` (private file upload) and `POST /v1/files/get` (private file download).
- Corrected the "keep these rules straight" bullet points to reflect the endpoint renames.

## [0.1.5-draft] - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- Updated health check expected `version` field to `"0.7.1"` (antd release e0dfa2c).
- Added `POST /v1/chunks/prepare` and `POST /v1/chunks/finalize` to the current shared daemon surfaces list (single-chunk external-signer flow, antd 0.7.0+).

## [0.1.4-draft] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- Updated health check expected shape to include the six new required fields added in antd v0.6.1: `version`, `evm_network`, `uptime_seconds`, `build_commit`, `payment_token_address`, `payment_vault_address`.
- Corrected the MCP daemon-discovery note: both `antd` and `antd-mcp` now use `ant/sdk/daemon.port`, so port-file discovery works without `ANTD_BASE_URL`.

## [0.1.3-draft] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- Re-verified the skill against current upstream source heads. No prose changes.
- Refreshed the pinned `ant-client` commit to track an internal payment-quote BLAKE3 peer-ID binding fix in `ant-core/src/data/client/quote.rs` (and a new typed `Error::BadQuoteBinding` variant). The fallback `Err(error) => ...` arm in the Direct Rust error-handling example still covers it.

## [0.1.2-draft] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Reverified the skill against the current docs layout and current upstream source heads.
- Added `ant-protocol` to the skill's verification scope for protocol-adjacent operational guidance.
- Refreshed SDK guidance to point at the current file-cost endpoint and current shared prepare/finalize semantics.
- Updated the maintenance guide to match the current component mapping and re-verification triggers.
- Refreshed the pinned `ant-client` and `ant-protocol` verification commits and clarified `LocalDevnet::create_funded_client(...)` in the Direct Rust playbook.

## [0.1.1-draft] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Moved the skill from `skills/autonomi-developer/` to `skills/start/` so the namespaced slash form is `/developer:start` instead of `/autonomi-developer:autonomi-developer`. Plugin identifier is now `developer` and the marketplace identifier is `withautonomi`. Internal `name:` and `skill:` fields and canonical URLs updated to match.

## [0.1.0-draft] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Initial in-repo `autonomi-developer` skill package.
- Operational path selector for SDK, CLI, Direct Rust, and MCP work.
- Exact golden flows for daemon health, SDK public data round-trip, CLI public file round-trip, and local devnet startup checks.
- Live reference table for the current docs site.
- Skill version manifest and maintenance guide.

### Changed
- Rebuilt the skill around the current docs and current upstream source artifacts instead of the earlier standalone draft.
- Reduced deep network internals so the skill stays focused on building and shipping applications.
